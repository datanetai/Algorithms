 *
 * You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real
 * numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the
 * equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a
 * single variable.
 * 
 * You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the
 * j^th query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.
 * 
 * Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined,
 * return -1.0.
 * 
 * Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries
 * will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
 * 
 * Note:Â The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are
 * undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries =
 * [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
 * Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
 * Explanation: 
 * Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
 * queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? 
 * return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
 * note: x is undefined => -1.0
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values =
 * [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
 * Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries =
 * [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
 * Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= equations.length <= 20
 * equations[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
 * values.length == equations.length
 * 0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
 * 1 <= queries.length <= 20
 * queries[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
 * Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.
