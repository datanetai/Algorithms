# A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The stu dents are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

# You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

# Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

def heightChecker(heights: list[int]) -> int:
    expected = sorted(heights)
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        if heights[i] != expected[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
